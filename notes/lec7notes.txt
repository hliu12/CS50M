API - Application Programming Interface

React components have APIs - you pass them propos
A class has an API - functions ect.
Need to read docs to understand how to use API

fetch() - used for getting web requests, returns a promise
The promise returns API info, which can be parsed into a json 
object 

fetch is often an async function that awaits the response from 
the promise so that it does not hold up the rest of the page/program

Since async functions don't have a .catch(), we can use try/catch

try {
    const response = await fetch('[API URL]');
    const result = await response.json();
    console.log(result);
} catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
}

can use componentDidMount to send out fetch request, we don't want
the request to hold up the application

Data coming from API is not always in the desired shape, and 
transformation is often needed. This transformation should be done
as early as possible. This creates an abstraction barrier - the 
rest of our app doesn't care about how we got the data.

POST requests allow a post body to abstract data away from the
URL.
