Lec 6 - Navigation
CS50 Mobile App Development with React Native

2 approaches to navigation: 
Do it all in JS - what React Native does
Write native codee

createSwitchNavigator switches between 2 screens
takes key-value pairs of route names and screen components

const AppNavigator = createSwitchNavigator({
    "RouteNameOne": ScreenComponentOne;
    "RouteNameTwo": ScreenComponentTwo;
})

class ScreenComponentOne extends React.Component {
    render() {
        <Text>This is screen one </Text>
    }
}

class ScreenComponentTwo extends React.Component {
    render() {
        <Text>This is screen two </Text>
    }
}

default class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <AppNavigator />;
    }
}

stackNavigator is a navigation system that pushes screens onto the 
stack so that popping screens off and going back to the previous
screen is simple and has its state and components already loaded

tabNavigation takes care of navigation between tabs and allows
navigation units to be children of main navigators to save multiple
navigation flows within the same app.
