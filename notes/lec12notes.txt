Testing Pyramid
Unit test - single class/function test
Integration/Service test - test multiple pieces of code independent of UI
UI/End-to-end tests - Tests a feature thoroughly

Testing frameworks are better than manually
written testing function since they can run
many testing functions simutaneously and give
prettier outputs

Jest - testing framework by Facebook
checks all .test.js files
uses this syntax:
test("describe the test here", () => {
 expect([recieved]).toBe(expected)
}

using .toEqual checks key value pairs instead of 
a hard ===, which checks object reference only
should use on for objects that shouldn't change

we can use .toMatchSnapshot() to save snapshots
of functions and only see when the snapshots are
changed in some way. This is good for when 
objects change, as snapshots can be updated.

can use describe("Describe group of tests", () => {
  it("test description", () => {//Test stuff}

Jest supports mock functions - jest.fn()
mockFunction.mock.calls shows the calls that the mock function made

Jest expo can also ensure that React Components are rendered 
correctly

jest --verbose --coverage
shows testing coverage over an app

Detox by Wix is doing end to end testing for react native
not fully done yet - needs more android support
